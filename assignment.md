## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is understand the variability in scientific approaches to answering the same question, and to familiarize yourself with some of those approaches. You will be responsible for understanding the details of their procedures, as well as the statistical methods employed. In order to appropriately answer the questions below, you will likely need to **read the papers multiple times**. I suggest that you skim each paper to get a broad understanding, then **re-read the papers** to understand the details. Attempting to answer the questions below without reading the entire paper will both be less accurate and take more time.

## Crowdsourcing Analytics (primary article)

1. Provide an overview of the purpose(s) of this study. Be sure to describe the **specific** contribution it makes to the scientific community. _(10 points)_

2. Provide an overview of the procedure of this study -- how did it seek to accomplish its purpose? _(10 points)_

3. Describe the structure of the dataset, including how data about skin-tone was represented. Then, identify specific limitations the data has for assessing the hypothesis. _(10 points)_

4. Table 2 shows the frequency of researchers including each covariate in their analysis. Does the distribution surprise you? Why/why not? _(10 points)_

5. Many of the results (of each individual analysis) are reported in terms of an _odds ratio_. Why is this? Define the odds ratio, and interpret (in plain text) what a specific odds ratio indicates (i.e., _"an odds ratio of 1.34 means that...")_). _(10 points)_

6. How did the authors (of the primary study) answer the question, _do teams with more statistical expertise use different approaches or arrive at different conclusions_? Did answers vary by statistical expertise? Be sure to define any technical terms that you use. _(10 points)_

## Supplement 5

1. Using the data/graphics in this section, describe how analysts' beliefs changed over time. Does this surprise you? Does this give you more or less faith in the scientific process? _(10 points)_

## Team 10 Analysis

1. This team chose to create new variables using the existing one. What new variables did they create, and why did they do this? _(10 points)_

2. In this analysis, the authors tested for _confounding_ prior to the analysis. What is a confounding variable, and what did the authors do with variables they found to be confounding? _(10 points)_

3. This study attempted to correct for **nested data**. Describe how the data in this study were _nested_, and how the study accounted for this structure. Then, provide an example of another (hypothetical) dataset which would have a nested structure. _(10 points)_

## Team 13 Analysis

1. Describe how (and why) this team manipulated the data prior to analysis. Do you believe the transformations performed were appropriate given the research question? _(10 points)_

2. Provide a **thorough** explanation of the modeling approached used by this team. Be sure to provide a detailed explanation of Poisson regression. _(10 points)_

3. Why did the authors need to _offset_ their Poisson model? _(10 points)_
